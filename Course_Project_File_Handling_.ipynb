        "# Introduction\n",
        "Efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. File handling plays a key role in being able to manage such data, and Python allows us to handle various file formats which are used to store such data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we are going to learn how to load, modify, and save files of three popular file formats which are used in the industry to handle data. These formats are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CSV**: CSV or comma-separated value files come with the file suffix *.csv* and, as the name suggests, have data values separated by commas. Each data entry is placed on a new line, and typically, the first line tends to store the names of columns. In our dataset, a CSV file is used to store sales values for each product over 14 days.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JSON**: JSON or JavaScript object notation files come with the file suffix *.json* and store data as key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. In our dataset, JSON files are used to store details such as product names, prices, and brands.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TXT**: TXT or text files come with the file suffix *.txt* and generally useful for storing single variables like strings or integers. In our dataset, TXT files are used to store descriptions of products."

        "- If you are using Google Colab:\n",
        "  - Upload the zip file containing the files in Google Drive or upload the zip file directly to the Google Colab runtime.\n",
        "    - Then unzip it using `unzip` shell command which you can access using the `!` (exclamation mark) character.\n",
        "  - Once you have mounted Google Drive into your Google Colab VM or uploaded the zip file directly to the Google Colab runtime.\n",
        "    - You can use the *Files* section on the left to access the filesystem. You can right click on a file or folder to copy its path. This will be useful while specifying the source file in the `unzip` shell command.\n",
        "  - You will need to pass the location of the main folder into the `load_data()` function to load *sales_data.csv* file and the files in *product_details* and *product_description* folders.\n",
        "- Inside the `load_data()` function, you can:\n",
        "    - use the `csv.DictReader()` method to read the *sales_data.csv* file, and to store the data as dictionaries with key-value pairs where the keys correspond to the column names in the first row,\n",
        "    - use the `os.listdir()` method to obtain the names of the files and folders within a particular folder,\n",
        "    - use `os.path.join()` to construct file paths,\n",
        "    - use the `json.load()` method to load JSON files, and\n",
        "    - use the `open()` function to load the text files.\n",
        "-  As you need to use the SKUs as keys in all three dictionaries, you can ask a generative AI tool like ChatGPT on how to extract the SKU values in all three cases.\n",
        "    - In *sales_data.csv* they have been saved in a column titled *Product_SKU*\n",
        "    - For the other two, you need to extract the SKU from the file name: you must obtain the SKU which lies between the prefix and the suffix. Try using the in-built string function `split()` (additionally, you can use `replace()` if you wish to write the code in one line).\n",
        "    - Provide the data description and requirements to ChatGPT along with the libraries that you are using and ask it to generate code for the function.\n",
        "    - If you get stuck somewhere, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and you can make edits as required."

The function should efficiently organize and dump each type of data into its corresponding file format: CSV for sales data, JSON for product details, and plain text for product descriptions. This exercise challenges learners to apply file I/O operations, directory management, and data serialization techniques in Python, ensuring they gain practical experience with data persistence, manipulation, and organization on the filesystem."

        "- Define a function named `dump_data()` that dumps product details, sales data, and product descriptions into files within a specified main folder.\n",
        "- The function should accept four parameters:\n",
        "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys and a list of sales quantities for the last 14 days as values.\n",
        "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details, with SKU as keys and details as values. Details include attributes like name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability.\n",
        "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys and the textual description of the product as values.\n",
        "  - `main_folder`: A string representing the location of the main folder, which should contain *product_details* and *product_descriptions* subfolders.\n",
        "- The function performs the following operations:\n",
        "  - Dumps the `sales_data` into a CSV file named *sales_data.csv* located in the *main_folder*. Each row in the CSV file represents the sales data for a product, with fields for the SKU and sales quantities for each of the 14 days.\n",
        "  - Dumps each entry in `product_details` into a separate JSON file within the *product_details* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the details of that product in JSON format.\n",
        "  - Dumps each product description from `product_descriptions` into a separate TXT file within the *product_descriptions* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the textual description of that product.\n",
        "- Prior to dumping product details and descriptions, the function checks if the respective subfolders exist. If not, it creates them.\n",
        "- Usage:\n",
        "  - The function is designed to persist the current state of sales data, product details, and product descriptions to the filesystem, allowing for data backup and recovery. It organizes the persisted data into a structured directory and file system based on the specified *main_folder* path.\n"
